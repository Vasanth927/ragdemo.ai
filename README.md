# ragdemo.ai
Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG) is a technique that enhances the capabilities of LLMs by combining information retrieval with text generation. Instead of relying on pre-trained knowledge, RAG fetch relevant data from external sources and use it to generate more accurate responses.

langchain  # core framework
langchain-huggingface  # Connect huggingface models to perform embedding
faiss-cpu  # Fast vector database to store embedded data
langchain-community  # extra integration
langchain-text-splitters  # to split large text into smaller chunks
sentence-transformers  # pre-trained embedding models to convert text into vectors
langchain-core  # document, chains etc...


##### In simple words

Text -> split text -> convert vector -> store in database -> search similar content -> send to LLM -> Get answers for questions

'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' -> Simple hugging face embedding model which splits the text and converts the text into vectors
